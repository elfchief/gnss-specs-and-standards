   (Initial version, 27 August 1998; version 2.00 final update, 16 June 1999)
                    (Version 3.02, 02 September 2010)


-. SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 3.00 and later

The changes introduced in version 3.00 are mostly to be consistent with
RINEX 3.00 and to recognize the use of other Global Navigation Satellite
Systems (GNSSs) besides the Global Positioning System (GPS):

  a. "RINEX VERSION / TYPE" header changed to 3.00 and to add satellite
     system designator.
  b. "PGM / RUN BY / DATE" header date format elaborated.
  c. "SYS / # / OBS TYPES" header added.
  d. Added Galileo and Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) satellite
     designators in Section 5.
  e. "TIME SYSTEM ID" header added.
  f. The satellite antenna phase center offset information has been moved
     from a mandatory comment to the "SYS / PCVS APPLIED" header and now
     includes the associated phase center variation information also.
     It is expected that an external file will be referenced.
  g. "SYS / DCBS APPLIED" header added.
  h. Capability of handling inter-system timing biases and new intra-lab
     biases (possibly as new types of CR data record) are under
     consideration but not yet adopted.
  i. In version 3.01 a few cases where "GPS time" was specified have been
     corrected to read "specified system time".
  j. In version 3.02 satellite codes for the QZSS ("Jnn") and COMPASS
     ("Cnn") systems as well as the QZSS system time designator ("QZS")
     have been added.


0. INTRODUCTION

Thus far, the IGS has produced clock results only for the GPS satellites
and these are tabulated and distributed at the 15-minute intervals used
in the sp3 orbit ephemerides files.  There is much interest in increasing
the satellite clock interval to 30 seconds (e.g., to overcome SA effects
on interpolation) and also in producing station clock results (at some
appropriate interval, probably 5 minutes).  In principle, the sp3 format
could continue to be used for both of these extensions, but it would be
wasteful considering that the vast majority of the file space is set
aside for orbit information.  Also, the variety of other clock
information that also needs to be exchanged does not lend itself to the
sp3 format.

Alternatively, the IGS could devise a new format specifically for
distributing clock information.  It does not appear that the timing
community already uses a standard data format that is well suited for the
IGS needs.


1. CLOCK DATA TYPES

At the level of monitoring and reporting data from a specific GPS station
(or more generally, a "receiver", which could include low Earth-orbiting
satellites and other non-stationary platforms) the following types of
observations can be expected:

       calibration data (CR):  time delay measurements between a GPS 
                               receiver and some external reference point
                               (e.g., local master clock)
     discontinuity data (DR):  a phase-tracking GPS receiver (e.g., AOA
                               TurboRogue) maintains an internal clock that
                               sometimes will reset itself; in principle,
                               there may be methods to monitor such changes
                               which could then be logged as a relative
                               change in clock state

From analysis of GPS data, the results for an ensemble of receiver and
satellite clocks can be determined differentially.  Normally, all clock
values are estimated relative to a single clock being held fixed as a
reference.  Alternatively, a linear combination of the estimated clocks
can be held fixed to some apriori value (normally, zero).  Either way,
all the clock values can be re-aligned after estimation to remove the
effect of the particular choice of reference clock, which can change for
each data analysis arc.  Such re-alignment is most commonly done using
broadcast GPS time for the satellites as an underlying timescale, typically
fitted to a low-order polynomial.  In any case, the data are:

       analysis data (AR,AS):  results from GPS phase/pseudorange data
                               analysis for a network of station/receiver
                               (AR) and satellite (AS) clocks, all relative
                               to a fixed reference clock (or ensemble)
                               adopted in the analysis

If a timescale re-alignment has been applied (e.g., to GPS time), then
the analysis reference clock will have non-zero values (but should still
be reported as the reference in the header records) and these must be
reported together with all other estimated clocks in the clock data
records.  In this case, the method of re-alignment should be described
in the header comment records.

In addition, the broadcast clocks of the satellites can be monitored and
compared to a laboratory standard:

           monitor data (MS):  broadcast values for satellite clocks as
                               compared with a laboratory standard via
                               monitor receivers (usually timing receivers)


2. FORMAT TYPES AND FILE NAMING

Following established practice, the receiver-specific data ("CR" and "DR")
could be reported using an extension of the RINEX format while the analysis
data ("Ax" and "MS") could be reported using an extension to a standard
product format, such as SINEX.  However, since all of these data types are
related and probably need similar format requirements, it seems more
economical to consider a single file format type suitable for all.

RINEX seems the most appropriate file type, even though it is not normally
used for analysis products.  When it becomes feasible and necessary to 
include clock estimates with other analysis products, then suitable
formats can be incorporated into SINEX.  Until then, it is suggested that
a RINEX format extension be used for all clock/timing results.  Normally,
"CR" and "DR" data types would be collected at the stations, files would be
prepared at the data centers, and the files would flow to the Global Data
Centers named as:

        for calibration data (CR) & discontinuity data (DR)
        ---------------------------------------------------
        ssssdddf.yyC      ssss:    4-character station/receiver name
                                   designator
                           ddd:    day of the year of first record
                             f:    file sequence number within day
                                   0: file contains all the existing
                                      data of the current day
                            yy:    year
                             C:    file type "C" for clock information

The suffix "C" would be a new RINEX file type.  Normally, data would be
compiled into files by each 24-hour day (according to the specified time
system).

The analysis results "AR", "AS", and "MS" would be formed at IGS Analysis
Centers or by IGS/BIPM Pilot Project analysis groups and would normally
include results for a number of stations/receivers and/or satellites.
These files would be named as:

        for analysis data (Ax) & monitor data (MS)
        ------------------------------------------
        cccwwwwd.clk       ccc:    3-character analysis center name
                                   designator
                          wwww:    GPS week number
                             d:    day within GPS week (0 - 7)
                           clk:    suffix to identify clock information
                                   product files

Files could be either daily (d = 0,...,6) or weekly (d = 7).

However, despite the file names, a single format for the contents would
apply for all data types.


3. NUMERICAL PRECISION

All timing quantities (units sec, sec/sec, sec/sec**2) are reported in
exponential format with a precision of 12 decimal places.


4. CLOCK DISCONTINUITIES

Clock discontinuities (in bias, rate, and/or acceleration) could be
reported in either of two ways.  If monitored in situ and logged, these
could be reported as "DR" data types in .yyC station files.  If detected
in data analysis, these can be reported in .clk files as two "AR" data
records for the same station at the same epoch but with two different
sets of clock values.


5. RECEIVER AND SATELLITE NAMES

Since the clock data are normally used in conjunction with data analysis
results (even for the calibration and discontinuity data types), it is
most convenient to use naming conventions for the receivers and
satellites which correspond to the same names used in analyses.  In order
to ensure uniqueness and complete identification, it is also necesssary
to supply the receiver ID number (for fixed terrestrial receivers, the
DOMES number issued by the Terrestrial Frame Section of the IERS).  Thus,
receivers should be identified by:

       Station names:     IGS official 4-character receiver name designator
       Station number:    DOMES number (or other unique identifier)

For satellite names, the following designations are used in RINEX:

       Satellite names:   3-character string:
                          "Gnn":   nn is the PRN number for GPS
                                   satellites
                          "Rnn":   nn is the slot number for
                                   GLONASS satellites
                          "Enn":   nn is the PRN number for Galileo
                                   satellites
                          "Cnn":   nn is the PRN number for COMPASS
                                   satellites
                          "Jnn":   nn is PRN-192 where PRN is the QZSS
                                   satellite PRN number
                          "Snn":   nn is PRN-100 for Satellite-Based
                                   Augmentation System (SBAS) payloads

If other satellite transmitters become available with suitable GPS- or
GLONASS-like signals, such as the geostationary platforms currently
being considered, then they can also be included using future RINEX
naming conventions.


6. RINEX CLOCK FORMAT DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES

The header recorders should be included in the order indicated, when
required.  The records below marked with * are optional.

It is recommended that each record be read into a blank buffer string
and then the information can be decoded afterwards from the buffer.
Header and data records are limited to 80 characters. If more than
bias and bias sigma are reported, a continuation line must be used.

A data file must begin with the header records.  Data records begin
immediately after the "END OF HEADER" record and complete the remainder
of the data file.
