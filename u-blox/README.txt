As far as I know, u-blox does not actually publish a "protocol version X"
kind of document for every protocol version. For the 6th, 7th, and 8th gen
devices, there are 'Receiver Description' documents which may or may not
be complete. Earlier models, and 9th gen models, don't have these generic
protocol documents, they just have model-specific documentation. For this
reason, multiple different 9th gen documents will exist here, until u-blox
puts out a generic 9th gen document.

I've been unable to find documentation prior to the 5th generation parts,
assuming they exist. Help?
